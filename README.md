## Mcip6
Mcip6 is a mod for minecraft that allows you to join ipv6 server.

This mod was made for minecraft bug https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-3776 to prove Minecraft works correctly works 

### Workings
Minecraft turn of ipv6 for unknown reasons when starting up, this makes it impossible for people who are on a ipv6 only network to play the game multiplayer. This limitation is hard coded into the source of Minecraft, however it can be bypassed using the correct java methods.

This mod bypasses the limitation of Minecraft by turning ipv4 only mode of and directly loading the networking before loading Minecraft gets a chance to force ipv4 only mode.

### Bugs

This mod seems to break opentolan functionality of Minecraft, more discovery is needed.

### How to install
